# o365creeper-ng

Stealthy O365 user validation

## Description

This is a simple Python script used to validate email accounts that belong to Office 365 tenants.
This script takes either a single email address or a list of email addresses as input,
sends a request to Office 365 without a password, and looks for the the "IfExistsResult"
parameter to be set to 0 for a valid account. Invalid accounts will return a 1.

After repeated attempts to validate email addresses, Office 365 will flag these requests randomly,
leading to false positives. This program will therefore search for the "ThrottleStatus" parameter
in order to decide if the response can be considered as valid or not. When the parameter is set to
1, this means that the server throttled our request. In this case, and if we are using Tor, the
program will try to regenerate the tor circuit and retry the last request. This generally
allows us to get reliable results.

Furthermore, this program will also make requests with random user agents in order to be even more
stealth.


## Dependencies

The [original project](https://github.com/LMGsec/o365creeper) was completely refactored and runs
now with `python 3.8` (it probably works with later versions but that hasn't been tested yet).

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management, so you can just
run:
```
poetry install
```

Dependencies can also be installed with `pip`:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Fireprox

It is recommended to use this tool in conjunction with [fireprox](https://github.com/ustayready/fireprox).
For that, you have to create a new API gateway pointing to
`https://login.microsoftonline.com`. Once you have received an URL like
`https://eid939cks.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/fireprox`, you can pass
it in the `-u` option.

## Tor

You may also use this tool with Tor support. For that, you will have to configure your
`torrc` to open a control port and set a password. Instructions can be found
[here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Tor#Open_Tor_ControlPort) and
[here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Tor#Set_a_Tor_Control_password).

In summary, you will have to generate a password hash with the command:

```
$ set +o history # unset bash history
$ tor --hash-password your_password
$ set -o history # set bash history
```
Add the generated hash to your `torrc`:

```
HashedControlPassword your_hash
```

Add these additional lines to your `torrc` to enable the control port:

```
ControlSocket /var/lib/tor/control_socket
ControlSocketsGroupWritable 1
DataDirectoryGroupReadable 1
```

Add the user who will run the program to the `tor` user group and restart the
Tor service.

To verify the ControlSocket permissions:

```
$ stat -c%a /var/lib/tor /var/lib/tor/control_socket

750
660
```

## Usage

The script can take a domain with the `-d` option, which will make it verify if
the given domain is managed by MSOnline. You are advised to do so before
attempt to enumerate.


To enumerate users, the script can take a single email address with the `-e` parameter or a list of email
addresses,
one per line, with the `-f` parameter.
Additionally, the script can output valid email addresses to a file with the `-o` parameter and
output throttled ones to a different file with the `--output-fail` parameter, in case you wish
to retry them later.

```
usage: o365creeper-ng.py [-h] [-e EMAIL] [-f FILE] [-u BASEURL] [-d DOMAIN] [-o OUTPUT] [--output-fail OUTPUT_FAIL] [--tor] [-p SOCKS_PORT]
